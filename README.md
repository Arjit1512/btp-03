# Drone Simulation in Different Terrains

## Overview
This project focuses on the simulation of drones in various terrains, including urban, rural, and forest environments. 
It incorporates advanced features such as sensor integration, autonomous and manual navigation, and obstacle avoidance using LIDAR sensors.

## Technical Details
- **3D Modeling**: Custom drone model created in Blender
- **Simulation Environment**: Unity
- **Programming**: C# for Unity scripting, MATLAB for data analysis
- **Sensors**: LIDAR, GPS
- **Communication**: Wireless link analysis between drone and base station
- **Data Processing**: FFMPEG for video encoding, CSV for data storage

## Case Study: UAV Wireless Link Analysis in Vegetation Terrain
1. Scenario creation based on physical measurements from a mango farm
2. Implementation of base station and signal transmission
3. Antenna signal strength analysis and path loss detection
4. Navigation using ray tracing propagation model
5. Frame and video transmission from drone camera to base station
6. Coordinate and dimension scaling in MATLAB

## Dependencies: 
- Unity3D, MATLAB, Blender, FFMPEG Video Decoder
